========================

Introduction
------------------------
[Tic Tac Toe Online in Python][2] is a socket-based Client-Server application in Python that allows multi-players to connect to the server and play Tic Tac Toe online with other players.  


Manual
------------------------
[Tic Tac Toe Online in Python][2] is a cross-platform game that should work on any modern desktop operating systems. The instructions below are demonstrated on a Linux distro, but you should be able to run this on Windows and Mac OS X as well.  

All the Python scripts in this project are written for Python 3.x. The client GUI requires Python Tkinter module. You need to set up the Python 3 environment before you start.  

To set up the server, please read [The Server Manual](http://chenyumin.com/p/tic-tac-toe-server-manual) or [docs/MANUAL-SERVER.md](docs/MANUAL-SERVER.md).  

To learn about the command-line based client script, please read [The Client Manual](http://chenyumin.com/p/tic-tac-toe-client-manual) or [docs/MANUAL-CLIENT.md](docs/MANUAL-CLIENT.md).  

To use the client GUI, directly run ttt_client_gui.py with python3.
