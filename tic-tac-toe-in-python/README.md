========================

Introduction
------------------------
Tic Tac Toe is a socket-based Client-Server application in Python that allows multi-players to connect to the server and play Tic Tac Toe online with other players.  


Manual
------------------------
Tic Tac Toe is a cross-platform game that should work on any modern desktop operating systems. The instructions below are demonstrated on a Linux distro, but you should be able to run this on Windows and Mac OS X as well.  

All the Python scripts in this project are written for Python 3.x. The client GUI requires Python Tkinter module. You need to set up the Python 3 environment before you start.  

To use the client GUI, directly run ttt_client_gui.py with python3.

	python3 ttt_client_gui.py
